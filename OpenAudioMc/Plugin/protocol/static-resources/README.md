# Project status file
This file serves as the source of truth regarding version info and some configuration.

Just like with protocol mappings, the backend reads this file for some important production configuration that may change over time and is served raw through github from the master branch.

A go struct mapping is provided in this directory, mostly so future me doesn't have to convert it again and check between projects.
