# Skywars hook

This module works with the [Skywars Reloaded](https://github.com/lukasvdgaag/SkyWarsReloaded) plugin, and is meant to streamline voicechat in skywars game servers.

Skywars behaviour:
 - Everyone will be in one big voicechat during non-game states
 - When a match is running, players will only be able to talk to their team mates
