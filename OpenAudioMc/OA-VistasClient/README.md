# Vistas-Client
Vistas is a swappable module, overwriting default networking behaviour to use a single stand alone OpenAudioMc installation act as the bridge between clients and servers. This is a workaround for networks like ImagineFun and Rinaorc to use OpenAudioMc in a custom mesh setup, independant from Bungeecord, Velocity or java entirely.

## Naming
This module is named after the band, Vistas.
Not because any specific reason, I just happened to wear their merchandise while creating this module.
